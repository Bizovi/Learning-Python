# Classic Computer Science Problems in Python

This directory is a **walkthrough** and **fork** of the D. Kopec [book](https://classicproblems.com/) and [repository](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython) examples (see [license](LICENSE)), with opportunistic tweaks of property-based testing, packaging, interactive visualization and dataclasses.
