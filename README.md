# Learning Python
Learn Python for scientific computing, data analysis and software development


### Build a RESTful API with Flask
The TDD way (Part 1, 2)

1. Write a test. – The test will help flesh out some functionality in our app
2. Then, run the test – The test should fail, since there's no code(yet) to
 make it pass.
3. Write the code – To make the test pass
4. Run the test – If it passes, we are confident that the code we've written
 meets the test requirements
5. Refactor code – Remove duplication, prune large objects and make the code
 more readable. Re-run the tests every time we refactor our code
6. Repeat – That's it!
