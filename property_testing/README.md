# Property-based testing in Python: Hypothesis


## Setup and Getting Started

A tooling which simplifies a lot of my workflows and smooths out the transition from development/exploration to production.

* `pyenv` for python versioning and virtual environments
* `poetry` as the package manager
* `micropipenv` for a more lightweight solution than poetry
* `Docker` for APIs and backend development
* `pypi` for a private package server
