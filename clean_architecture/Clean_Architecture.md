# Explorations in Clean Architecture

Following the talk and the book of **Leonardo Giordani** (Clean Architectures in Python) in order to get a better grasp of the concepts, adapted for Python.


## Getting started

I'm using `pyenv` to manage my python versions and environments. The version of choice is `3.8` 

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8-dev clean_architectures
pyenv activate clean_architectures 
pip install --upgrade pip
```
