  Hi everybody! This blog is about things Iâ€™m passionate about.
  I can hardly imagine myself in a place of narrow specialization
  and the exploration of connections between fields brings me a lot
   of joy. I love writing about economics, solving business problems
   with statistical models and programming in R.
